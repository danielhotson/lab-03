## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: Because there is a seperation between the client and the server making it significantly easier to up or downscale the server as needed.

Answer for Question 2: The resources the mail server is providing is the mail text as well as lists of inboxes.

Answer for Question 3: We dont use the PUT method. We could extend it to use Put by including a command to update or edit and existing mail that has been sent.

Answer for Question 4: API keys are used to identify the project making a call to the API and check whether the specific project has been granted access to call the API in the project. This allows for the API to monitor what projects are calling it and restrict what projects can access it.
